# Quarantine-Management-System
**Quarantine Management System implemented in c++.**

## Project Author
**Mansi Rawat**

## **Aim**
The aim of this project is to build a Quarantine centre management system which by taking in user data and resolve queries based on the retrived data.

## **breif description**
This project uses the the basic and important concepts of c++ and object oriented programming to implement the basic structure of qurantine centre management.
It's important functions are room allocation to the user, segregation of users into classes like covid positive and covid negative based upon the data provided by them.
Uses the important STLs to create data-structures and various algorithms of our own to make it more efficient and fast.

**This project uses almost all the important concepts of c++ and Object Oriented Programming to manage the Quarantine centre in a best possible way.**

## Project Structure and Implementation Overview :  ##

### main - contains the body of the program,used to perform all the operations on the entries.
### Person.cpp - contains *Person* class.
### Person.h - contains header files of the class *Person*.
### Covid_pos.cpp - child class of *Covid_pos* class.
### Covid_pos.h - contains header files of *Covid_pos* class.
### Covid_neg.cpp - child class of *Covid_neg* class.
### Covid_neg.h - contains header files of *Covid_neg* class.
### room_check.cpp - search for all the rooms.
### room_check.h - contains headers of the *room_check*.
